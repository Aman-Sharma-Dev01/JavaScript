      API Requests: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules
      and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate
      and interact with each other. In the context of web development, APIs are
      commonly used to request and exchange data between a client (usually a web
      browser or a mobile app) and a server. API requests are a way for the
      client to request specific data or perform certain actions from the
      server. This is typically done using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT,
      DELETE, etc. The client sends a request to the server, and the server
      responds with the requested data or performs the requested action.
